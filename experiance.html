    <h2>Internship EXPERIANCES</h2><hr> 
        <p><b>METECH logistic and maintenance office /Assistant engine mechanic/ </b> <br>
             <br>
            This is the only company that maintains all military cars in Ethiopia.
            The internship offered me practical experience by allowing me to
            apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios and develop
            industry-specific skills. This experience enabled me to build valuable
            professional networks and gain insights into the industry while
            exploring potential career paths.
            During the internship, I developed essential soft and technical skills,
            boosting my professional confidence while understanding the various
            work cultures and honed my project management & communication
            skills by coordinating with cross-functional teams and where
            Iproduced project updates to the chief supervisor. This opportunity
            provided me to further enhance the foundation in mechanical
            engineering to acquire a competent personality for future professional
            challenges</p>
